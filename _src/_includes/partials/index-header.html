    <h1>Eleventy deep pagination</h1>
    <p>
    This is a demo of double layered pagination with navigation scoped to tagged content using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator. Following a discussion I had with Tobias on the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/news/discord/">11ty Discord</a> about multi-level pagination. 
    I started to search on the topic and found <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/332">issue #332</a>. 
    Then I wanted to experiment with it and created this little prototype. While tinkering, I faced the same situation as 
    <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1120">issue #1120</a>. My solution was to create a navigation object from the first collection using the collection API.
    The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/solution-loisir/eleventy-deep-pagination">GitHub</a>!
