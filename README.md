# eleventy-deep-pagination
This is a demo of double layered pagination with navigation scoped to tagged content using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.Following a discussion I had with Tobias on the [11ty Discord](https://www.11ty.dev/news/discord/) about multi-level pagination. I started to search on the topic and found [issue #332](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/332). Then I wanted to experiment with it and created this little prototype. While tinkering, I faced the same situation as [issue #1120](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1120). My solution was to create a navigation object from the from the first collection using the collection API.The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/solution-loisir/eleventy-deep-pagination)!
